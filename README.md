# ðŸ’˜ Love Score Calculator (Python)

This is a fun Python script that calculates a "Love Score" based on the names you enter.

## ðŸ§  Logic

The code counts how many times the letters in the words **"TRUE"** and **"LOVE"** appear in both names.

- Total `"true"` letter count = `number_1`
- Total `"love"` letter count = `number_2`
- Final score = `number_1` + `number_2` (e.g., if `number_1 = 4`, `number_2 = 6`, score = **"46"**)

## ðŸ§ª Sample Output

```bash
What is your name? Harry
What is your partner's name? Ginny
Love score: 56
